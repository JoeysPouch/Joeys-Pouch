# Joeys-Pouch

Hi all! I'm Joey. I'm a guy from Nottingham with a lot of interests, one of which is data. I've worked primarily at universities but in a pretty diverse set of roles - from social statistics textbooks to supply chain data migration. That said, I do have a real soft spot for quantitative surveys and 'turning opinions into numbers'. I've tried to branch out a bit recently, though.

## Here are a few things I've done you might find interesting.

My proudest achievement is ThePoliticsWedgesite.co.uk. It uses a statistical and visual framework I developed during my MA to auto-generate graphs that draw out the level of polarisation between two groups on an issue of your choice. It was a joint project between myself and my incredibly talented partner, Zarrin. You can find it here. Try it out! 

This is a fairly academic introduction to the aforementioned framework from the website above It goes through the geometric interpretations, the statistical proofs and all the lovely mathematical properties, as well as giving a couple of illustrative examples.

This is a little visual report from some analysis I did on the Open University Learning Analytics Data Set, which contains an extroadinary wealth of data on student characteristics and the specific ways they interact with their online learning environments. I was a bit bored of learning about 'average score at university of x demographic compared to y' so decided to dig a bit deeper into the tail ends of the distribution and explored the characteristics of real high fliers. It was also my first attempt at machine learning that wasn't logistic regression!

[This](https://github.com/JoeysPouch/Joeys-Pouch/blob/main/Put-BA-Project-Here) is a business analytics project I did as part of a course.

If you're interested, here are a couple of papers I wrote at university in the area of quantitative public opinion: 

- [This](https://github.com/JoeysPouch/Joeys-Pouch/blob/main/MA-Dissertation.pdf) is my dissertation! It's sort of on both of the topics above. It was my first attempt at applying the polarisation parallelogram to an actual set of issues. I found that, while the idea of the USA becoming 'Majority-Minority' was a fairly polarising concept, the most polarisation between liberals and conservatives on the question came on the issue of whether it'll strengthen or weaken customs and values in the country. It also contains a few musings about the quantitative measurement of political ideology.
- [This](https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepositoryname/blob/Migration-Attitudes-And-Critique-Of-BSA-Quant-Scale/.pdf) started out as a paper on public attitudes to immigration but ended up with something more interesting. I discovered that the British Social Attitudes Survey measures 'Left-Right Wing' with nothing more than an average score over six questions, ALL of which are about economics. As a result, there's allegedly no relationship at all between 'left-wing politics' and 'support for immigration', which to me is an indication that the scale is too narrow. How to measure political ideology is itself a fascinating debate, by the way. 

I'm also hoping to be able to share the bank of questions I wrote for an upcoming textbook soon!
